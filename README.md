# wordlecheats
A little tool for cheating at Wordle
<br>
The full app tutorial/description can be found in README.txt

Many full lists of English words can be found online...
This one might be the most comprehensive in particular: <a>https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt</a>

I really hope the *.exe file works on your computer, but if it doesn't then I probably screwed up the compilation somehow...
In that case, you can either compile the C file yourself or let me know that I screwed something up.

Any comments, complaints, conundrums, etc. are welcome!
